    "##### As you might imagine, floating-point numbers tend to consume more space in memory because of their complexity. In addition, they use an entirely different area of the processor — one that works more slowly than the part used for integer math. Finally, integers are less precise, as contrasted to floating-point numbers, which can’t precisely represent some numbers, so you get an approximation instead. However, floatingpoint variables can store much larger numbers. The bottom line is that decimals are unavoidable in the real world, so you need floating-point numbers, but using integers when you can reduces the amount of memory your application consumes and helps it work faster. There are many trade-offs in computer systems, and this one is unavoidable."
